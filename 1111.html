<h2>What Is Yoga?</h2>

<p><font color=white size=4 face="Copperplate Gothic"> The literal translation of the word “yoga” from Sanskrit (which is recognized as the original language of yoga) is “union,” says Sherwin. (2) And that’s an apt basis for defining yoga as we know it today, she explains. “We define it as bringing together the mind and the body by use of the breath.”

Many people have come to know the physical benefits of yoga and think of it as a type of workout, says Sherwin. But yoga is way more than that. “It’s really an entire lifestyle; the postures are only one piece of it,” she says.

Yoga began in India and has been around for about 5,000 years, says Sherwin. “Originally it was taught one-on-one and only to men of the highest caste,” she says.</p></font>
